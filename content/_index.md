Hi!, I'm Eoin Motherway. I'm Software Engineer at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com).

I'm a big fan of DevOps, automation, software architecture, privacy, and security.

Outside of software, I'm a student pilot, aviation enthusiast, amateur photographer and music producer.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yukitsune) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yukitsune256).
